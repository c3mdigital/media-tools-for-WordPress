== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do?

This plugin allows you to go through all your posts, pages, or custom post types and import any externally referenced images into your media library
and attaches them to the post and can even set the first image as the featured image.

It also enables post thumbnail support if your current theme does not support post thumbnails.  You can even define a custom thumbnail image size.

= I moved my website to a new domain and server and none of my images are showing in the media library or in my posts.  How can I fix this?

If the images are still on the old server you can use this plugin to re import all of them into your media library.  You will want to first delete your
your images from the media library so it un attaches the broken links from your posts then run the import tool to re attach them and import them back into
your media library.

= Isn't it illegal to download images and show them on my website?

If you do not have permission to use the images then yes it is a copyright violation to use other peoples images on your website.  It is your
responsibility to make sure you have legal right to use any images.  PLEASE DON'T USE THIS PLUGIN TO VIOLATE COPYRIGHT LAWS!
